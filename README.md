# Regembly Documentation

Regembly is an [esolang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) I made that is run by a
[regex (regular expression)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). It uses some sneaky tricks of .Net's
implementation of regex to make it possible to have finite loops.

--------

## The language supports:

- Declaring and manipulating variables.
- Comparison and conditions of those variables.
- Loops.
- Call stack.

--------

The documentation is made from one html file that describes and gives examples for all the features in the language.
It also allows switching between the example Regembly and it's equivelent C# code (both simplified and direct).

It's available to view [here](https://mrjaydanoz.github.io/regembly-documentation/).
